# Threadify Workflows stable releases

## 0.4.1

- Prevents duplicate discovery by excluding the universal `~/.agents` target from native `--targets all` installations.
- Keeps `~/.agents/skills` available as an explicit target and as the fallback when no native client is detected.
- Reconciles and removes only stale Threadify-managed targets when the selected client set changes.

## 0.4.0

- Makes Qualified Buyer Research self-contained for standalone agent installation.
- Adds a versioned public durable ruleset and redacted proposal contracts.
- Adds stable-channel install, update, status, rollback, and uninstall commands.
- Adds daily and on-use update checks with explicit consent, locking, validation, atomic switching, cached fallback, and rollback.
- Keeps private FC5 context, voice samples, student data, account identifiers, and raw outcomes outside the public repository.
- Changes twenty-outcome learning from automatic public mutation to `promotion_recommended`; Lennox approves a public release by merging its tested release PR.
